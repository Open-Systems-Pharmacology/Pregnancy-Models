# Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models for Pregnant Women

Within this repository, we distribute the physiologically-based whole-body models for Pregnant Women published in [[1,2,3](#references)].

The models comprise 27 compartments, including nine pregnancy-specific compartments as shown in the schema below.

## Repository files
* The models are provided as ready-to-use MoBi projects (subfolder _Models_)
  * _Cefazolin_, _Cefuroxime_ and _Cefradine_ model evaluation is described in [[3](#references)]
  * _Caffeine_, _Midazolam_, _Nifedipine_, _Metoprolol_, _Ondansetron_, _Granisetron_, _Diazepam_ and _Metronidazole_ model evaluation is described in [[1](#references)]

* _BuildingBlocks_ subfolder contains MoBi building block for spatial structure and passive transports. Those building blocks can be used in MoBi to build new substance models.

## HowTo
Currently, simulations based on pregnant individuals cannot be built up directly in PK-Sim (due to the fact that e.g. for the protein model not all required data was collected). 

### How to combine an existing (MoBi) pregnancy model with a pregnancy population created in PK-Sim
Steps 3 to 5 are performed in PK-Sim.
1. If a (MoBi) pregnancy model is available in **pkml** format, go to the step 3
2. If a (MoBi) pregnancy model is available in **mbp3** format (MoBi project): open it in MoBi, select simulation of interest and save it in pkml format
3. Create an Individual using population **Pregnant (Dallmann et al. 2017)**

   _Of note, in PK-Sim®, the fertilization age (FA) is defined via the individual’s age, with 30 years corresponding to a FA of 0 weeks (i.e. just prior to conception). Hence, a pregnant woman with a FA of 38 weeks is defined using an age of 30.75 years._

4. Create a pregnancy population with the required settings based on the individual above
5. Import (MoBi) pregnancy model in **pkml** format and combine it with created population building block as described in the [OSP Suite manual](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite.Documentation/blob/master/Open%20Systems%20Pharmacology%20Suite.pdf) (**Ch. 21.2 Importing Individual and Population Simulation**)

### How to create a new pregnancy model
The procedure will be desribed in a comprehensive tutorial that will be published soon.


## Version information
The physiology is based on the PBPK model implemented in PK-Sim version 6.3. The MoBi project files were created in version 6.3.
